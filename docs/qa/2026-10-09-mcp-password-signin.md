## Password sign-in follow-up (2026-10-09)
Consent page now supports password sign-in alongside explicit email sign-in, plus a private Set password form for an authenticated account. Password fields are cleared after requests; no credentials are logged or persisted by Raven. OAuth approval, grant checks and token validation are unchanged.

User states they never defined a password. A read-only aggregate found one Auth account with a nonempty credential field; this does NOT prove the user knows a usable password. The owner must privately set their password in their existing signed-in consent tab, or complete one email sign-in after the rate limit clears. No password was set by the agent and no email was sent.

Verified locally: seven installed-Edge consent tests (synthetic auth, real pinned SDK load, mobile layout), mobile screenshot inspected, all 45 syntax/core/secret commands in test.yml, and whitespace checks. Local Node v24.19.0; CI remains Node 22. Codex sandbox shell still fails setup; approved alternate execution works. Existing signed-in browser automation was not retried. Actual ChatGPT tools remain unavailable in this chat; token issuance, tool retrieval/save and Raven reload remain unverified. Paid pilot PR58 is inactive; user data untouched.
