# Raven execution handoff

Updated: 2026-09-28 UTC

Cloudflare Billing Read is enabled; live health verified Workers Free and primary_provider=cloudflare at 04:26:57Z. Generate both remains deployed. No source-code or billing-plan change in this QA session.


## Authorized Cloudflare live QA (2026-09-28 UTC)
- User explicitly approved sending verified candidate background and selected stored job descriptions to Cloudflare and the existing free OpenRouter fallback for four document pairs and revisions. This supersedes the earlier approval blocker.
- API-only checks used Parallel Senior Environment Artist, Stone Kite Staff Environment Artist, VetJobs/Pinnacle Intermediate 3D Artist (location stripped from requested title), and Accurx Implementation Analyst. No saved documents were overwritten or submitted.
- All eight initial requests returned HTTP 200 and document objects. Resumes: 0/4 AI, 4/4 source-fact fallback (INVALID_DRAFT twice, PROVIDER_TIMEOUT once, REQUEST_BUDGET_EXCEEDED once). Covers: 3/4 Cloudflare AI, 1/4 source-fact fallback due to PROVIDER_TIMEOUT. Total observed latency 4.5–17.5 seconds; Cloudflare cover successes 13.3–16.0 seconds.
- Cat-voice revision returned HTTP 429 REQUEST_BUDGET_EXCEEDED with retryAfterSeconds=560 after three resume failures triggered the existing ten-minute circuit. Other three revision requests were not sent during this cooldown; tonal QA remains incomplete. Do not disable safety/budget guards merely to pass QA.
- Supabase request events confirm the two invalid drafts, two provider timeouts (one resume/one cover), and three cover successes. Health verification remains true for Workers Free.
- Cloudflare connectivity is demonstrated by real cover-letter output, but resume AI reliability is NOT accepted. Cover prose also needs editorial review (generic opening/repetition and an unverified personal enthusiasm claim in the Accurx draft); generation success is not editorial approval. Browser persistence/PDF testing was not performed in this API-only pass.
- Next: diagnose invalid-draft validation with bounded diagnostics and address timeout behavior, then rerun resumes and all four tonal revisions after the normal cooldown. User authorization for these provider/data transfers persists.
