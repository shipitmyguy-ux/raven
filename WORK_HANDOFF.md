# Raven execution handoff

Updated: 2026-09-28 UTC

User authorized a bounded repair rather than a full rebuild and approved provider transfers of canonical background and selected job descriptions. Cloudflare Workers Free is active.


## Final bounded repair verification (2026-09-28 UTC)
- Deployed resume v103 / cover v76. Current frontend app.js v61 / modern-v13-structured-writer; core repair commit 1b64a8d passed core CI, browser regression, Pages deployment, and both production smoke runs.
- Confirmed root causes: exact bullet-count rejection in the retired parser; full-document repairs exceeding deadline; missing mandatory history; invalid employer references/attribution; and non-game framing errors being discovered only after an earlier passage was repaired.
- Final source additionally constrains experience IDs to canonical IDs, collects framing errors alongside passage errors, restores omitted required roles with canonical source facts, and replaces an unrepaired misattributed initial bullet with that employer's own verified source text. These recoveries are marked as source_fact_passages; revisions never use them.
- Live initial results across the final batch and focused corrective retests: Parallel resume Cloudflare/no source passages 36.0s; Stone Kite resume Cloudflare/no source passages 29.8s; VetJobs/Pinnacle resume Cloudflare/no source passages 31.4s; Accurx resume Cloudflare/one source-fact bullet 29.9s. These are incremental retest results, not a claim that all four passed in one run on v103. No full-document fallback remained in the final result for any of the four jobs.
- Latest cover batch: 4/4 Cloudflare, no source-fact passages, 12.6–20.6s. Cat/goofy/formal/punchy revisions: 4/4 Cloudflare with obvious requested tones, 29.0–37.5s, no source fallback. Canonical employer/role/date sequences matched the prior draft.
- Revision limitation: the tests requested summary-only edits, but wording elsewhere also changed. Tone behavior passes; exact section-only edit scope does NOT yet pass and must not be described as verified. Saved user documents were never overwritten; no approvals or employer submissions were performed.
- 45 focused execution tests and repository secret scan pass. Final source commit 3f70af4 passed Reusable core tests (including targeted browser checks) and Production Smoke Tests; earlier frontend commit 1b64a8d also passed the full Browser regression and Pages deployment. Production browser loaded/synced and v61 was served. Existing mocked browser persistence/failed-revision regressions passed; no new real-model PDF rendering or persistence write was performed.
- Rate quota, provider outage circuit, Workers Free validation, zero-price routing, and two-call ceiling remain in place. No circuit records were reset.
