# Raven execution handoff

Updated: 2026-09-28 UTC

User approved the bounded repair and continued live testing through Cloudflare/free OpenRouter with the verified profile and stored jobs. Source/test changes are being published; final live QA remains in progress.


## Structured writer repair (2026-09-28 UTC, verification underway)
- Live diagnostic on resume v96 confirmed INVALID_DRAFT: wrong number of bullets for Highwire Games. The retired plain-text writer required exact line counts; the inference connection was working.
- Removed the separate initial resume writer. Initial resumes, covers, and revisions now share the structured full-profile writer and evidence validator. Identity, dates, employers, education, and job-location exclusions retain existing rendering behavior.
- One draft plus one repair matches the two-call router ceiling. Repair requests return only rejected passages and cannot overwrite valid passages. Initial drafts may use cited source text only for unrepaired passages, clearly marked as mixed output; failed revisions preserve the saved document.
- Initial/revision generation deadlines are 40/45 seconds, excluding profile/database/network overhead. Rate limits and free-plan/zero-price checks remain intact. Validation rejections consume quota but do not count as provider outages.
- All core regression files and 42 focused tests passed. First live repair pass v97/v71: 3/4 resumes AI, one timeout fallback; 4/4 covers had AI prose, two with one source-fact passage. Whole-document revision repairs still timed out, prompting passage-only repairs.
- Latest passage-only repair requires final live validation after the existing outage cooldown naturally expires. No cooldown records were reset; no saved documents were overwritten.
